Question 5
Scenario 2: (Assume the car is driving on the right-hand side of the road) .

- [x] Wait for the pedestrians to finish crossing before turning

- [x] The green car arrives at the stop sign after you and plans to travel straight through the intersection. You choose to move first.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6
Here are some rules for driving at a stop sign. Which of the following is an appropriate priority ranking?

1) For non all-way stop signs, stop at a point where you can see oncoming traffic without blocking the intersection

2) If there are pedestrians crossing, stop until they have crossed

3) If you reach a stop sign before another vehicle, you should move first if safe



- [x] 2, 1, 3

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Question 7
Which of the following are off-road objects? (Select all that apply)


- [x] Trees

- [x] Curbs

- [x] Road markings

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 9

Question 10
Scenario 3: You are on the highway and you see a truck in front of you. Assume the car is driving on the right-hand side of the road. There is also a blue car beside the truck in the other lane.

- [x] Longitudinal


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 11
You decide to change lanes to pass a truck. What kind of decision is this?




- [x] Short term planning

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 12
Which of the following tasks are rule-based planning? (Select all that apply)




- [x] If there are vehicles directly beside us on the lane, it is unsafe to lane change.




- [x] During a lane change, maintain our current speed or accelerate slightly

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 13
Suppose the blue vehicle suddenly brakes and you decide to abort the lane change. If your vehicle can respond automatically and remain in its own lane, what is the minimum level of autonomy of your vehicle?



- [x] 3


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 14
The blue vehicle returns to normal speed and you can now safely change lanes. Your car is performing the lane change, what kind of control is this?




- [x] Lateral

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 15
Scenario 4: You are almost at work but encounter a construction site.

![p3](https://github.com/Pdshende/Self-Driving-Cars-Specialization/blob/master/Pictures/Screenshot%20from%202020-05-29%2016-53-43.png)

Assume the car is driving on the right-hand side of the road. Your vehicle is denoted in orange.


You see a construction site where the workers are repaving a road full of potholes. They are using jackhammers which can cause dust clouds.

You create the following decision tree for getting through the construction site. From the diagram, which of the following decisions should you make? (green is true, red is false)

![p4](https://github.com/Pdshende/Self-Driving-Cars-Specialization/blob/master/Pictures/Screenshot%20from%202020-05-29%2016-55-56.png)



- [x] B (False)

- [x] C (True)

- [x] E (True)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 16
Here are a set of rules for making these decisions, arrange them in an appropriate prioritization.

1) If there are no vehicles ahead, accelerate to the speed limit

2) Drive slowly in construction zones

3) If there are pedestrians or workers directly ahead in the current lane, stop

4) Yield to merging vehicles, if necessary





- [x] 3, 4, 2, 1
